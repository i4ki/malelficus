This blog is based on work of TJ Stein. Thanks!

[This repository](https://github.com/secplus/malelficus/patito.github.com) 

The site is powered by Jekyll and built on mostly valid HTML5 and CSS3. Posts are in markdown.

The only plugin I use currently is for pagination so you'll need the jekyll-pagination (0.0.3) gem.

<pre>gem install jekyll-pagination</pre>
